Devola - ARP Spoofing Detection Tool v1.0

Not actually the best, but open-source and, hey, i'm only a beginner!

Has four main features:

- Scans incoming ARP traffic for abnormalities
- Creates it's own ARP Table and scans it
- Disables interfaces which is under ARP Spoofing attack
- Obtains and checks Windows ARP Table for abnormalities

Contibution to Egolds as I used his code in DevolaFormStyle control

and to Yoko Taro as the name given to this tool belongs to his character

Have fun and take care!
